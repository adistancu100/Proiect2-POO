The project is designed to practice and demonstrate core OOP concepts:
- **Class inheritance**
- **Virtual functions and polymorphism**
- **Operator overloading**
- **Dynamic memory management**
- **Custom class hierarchies**

It simulates an agenda that stores different types of contacts, including Skype users from Romania and abroad.
